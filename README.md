## Before You Begin — Read the Code

Open `ga_knapsack.py` and read through it. Then answer these questions.

**Q1. What does the `fitness()` function return? Why does an overweight solution score 0?**

```
[ The fitness() function return the total value of the selected items if their total weight is within the knapsack capacity. ]
```

**Q2. What does `tournament_select()` do? Why are higher-fitness individuals more likely to be chosen?**

```
[ tournament_select() randomly selects a small group of individuals from the population and chooses the one with the highest fitness among them. ]
```

**Q3. Look at the `run_ga()` loop. Find this line:**
```python
next_gen = [best_chromosome[:]]
```
**What is this doing? Why is it important to always keep the best solution?**

```
[ This line copies the best chromosome from the current generation into the next generation without any changes (elitism). ]
```

## Experiment 1 — Baseline Run

**Instructions:** Run the program without changing anything.
```bash
python ga_knapsack.py
```

**Fill in this table:**

| Metric | Your result |
|--------|-------------|
| Number of generations | |
| Best value at generation 1 | |
| Final best value | |
| Total weight of best solution (kg) | |
| Is solution valid (Yes / No) | |

**Copy the printed packing list here:**
```

```

**Look at `plots/experiment_1.png` and describe what you see (2–3 sentences).**  
*Where does the biggest improvement happen? Does the curve flatten at some point?*
```
[ YOUR OBSERVATION ]
```

## Experiment 2 — Effect of Mutation Rate

**Instructions:** In `ga_knapsack.py`, find the `# EXPERIMENT 2` block in `__main__`.  
Copy it three times and run with `mutation_rate` = **0.01**, **0.05**, and **0.30**.  
Save plots as `experiment_2a.png`, `experiment_2b.png`, `experiment_2c.png`.

**Results table:**

| mutation_rate | Final best value | Weight (kg) | Valid? | Shape of curve |
|--------------|-----------------|-------------|--------|----------------|
| 0.01         |                 |             |        |                |
| 0.05         |                 |             |        |                |
| 0.30         |                 |             |        |                |

**Compare the three plots. What happens when mutation is too low? Too high? (3–4 sentences)**  
*Hint: Too low = no diversity, may get stuck. Too high = random search. What is the sweet spot?*
```
[ YOUR OBSERVATION ]
```

**Which mutation_rate gave the best result? Why do you think that is?**
```
[ YOUR ANSWER ]
```
